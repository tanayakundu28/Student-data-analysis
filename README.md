# Student Scores Data Analysis Project

This data analysis project aims to explore and gain insights from a dataset of student scores. The dataset contains information about students' scores in various subjects, their gender, parents' education level, parent marital status, study hours, and ethnicity.

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze the dataset and uncover patterns and trends related to student scores. By performing visualizations and data analysis, we aim to answer questions such as the impact of parents' education on student scores, the variation of scores based on gender, the relationship between study hours and scores, and the distribution of ethnicity among students.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:

- Gender: Indicates the gender of the student (Male/Female).
- Math Score: The score obtained by the student in the Math subject.
- Reading Score: The score obtained by the student in the Reading subject.
- Writing Score: The score obtained by the student in the Writing subject.
- Parental Education: The level of education of the parents.
- Parental Marital Status: Indicates the marital status of the parents.
- Study Hours: The number of hours the student spent studying.
- Ethnicity: The ethnicity of the student.
- and many more...

## Analysis Steps

1. Gender Distribution: Visualized the distribution of students based on gender using a bar plot.
2. Impact of Parents' Education: Analyzed the effect of parents' education on student scores using visualizations and statistical analysis.
3. Parent Marital Status: Examined the relationship between parent marital status and student scores.
4. Variation of Scores Based on Gender: Investigated the variation in scores across different subjects based on gender using bar plots.
5. Study Hours vs. Scores: Explored the relationship between study hours and student scores through visualizations.
6. Ethnicity Distribution: Visualized the distribution of students across different ethnicities using a pie chart.

## Tools Used

The following tools and libraries were used in this project:

- Python programming language
- Pandas library for data manipulation
- Seaborn library for data visualization
- Matplotlib library for additional data visualization

## How to Use the Project

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python IDE of your choice.
2. Run the notebook or Python script to perform the data analysis and visualize the results.
3. Explore the visualizations and analysis findings to gain insights into the student scores dataset.

## Conclusion

Through this data analysis project, we have gained valuable insights into the student scores dataset. We have observed the impact of parents' education, parent marital status, study hours, and gender on student scores. The visualizations and analysis conducted provide a comprehensive understanding of the dataset and can be further utilized for decision-making and educational insights.
